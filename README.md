BitAires Website
================

This website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

To compile the website, first install required gems from `.gems`:

    dep install

If you don't have `dep` installed, you can use good ol' `xargs`.

After that, compile it with:

    jekyll build --watch

Or load a local webserver with:

    jekyll serve --watch

Pull requests welcomed!
